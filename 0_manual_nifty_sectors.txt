1.
Manually download NIFTY sectorian indices from https://www.niftyindices.com/reports/historical-data
The various sectarian indices are defined in https://www.niftyindices.com/indices/equity/sectoral-indices/

ERRATA
In NIFTY_REALTY file downloaded frin Nifty sectarian indices: 
the first few entries correspond to some data in 2014 instead of 2024.
From 2-May-2014 to 26-May-2014
This is weird. I removed them manually from "notepad".
NOTE that: If you save a CSV from XL, it may change the data format of certain fields.
           Hence using notepad to save a CSV file is a better option.

2.
Download GDP of all countries from World economic outlook database
https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2023/October/
Download entire database using the 'Entire dataset' link.
You should get a 9MB Excel file.
